### Description

Create/Edit Animated Cursors by Robert Rayment. As well as drawing the frames of an animated cursor, provides a set of step changes across the frames or a selected area for peppering, waving, swirling, squashing & Xfading. Frames can also be step changed for rotation and reduction. So this prog automates some kinds of animation. 1,4,8 & 24 bpp images can be handled. Some effects are included for 24 bpp images. Images can be loaded from ani, cur or ico files as well as captured from a bmp, gif or jpg. Title, author, number of frames, HotX & HotY and frame rates can be changed. For a new cursor any of the bpps can be selected. Some example ani-files are included. Cursors can be tested and saved at any stage. Please read the help for limitations. (Tested on Win98 & WinXP, Zip 82KB) (3 Oct Calc duration in frmDetails, system cursor preserved).
